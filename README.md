# Rock-Paper-Scissors
This is a simple implementation of the classic game "Rock-Paper-Scissors" in Python. The game allows the user to choose between rock, paper, and scissors by entering the corresponding number (0 for rock, 1 for paper, and 2 for scissors). The computer randomly selects its choice, and the program determines the winner based on the rules of the game.

The game uses ASCII art to display the chosen moves of both the user and the computer. After displaying the choices, the program determines the outcome and prints the result (whether the user won, lost, or it was a draw).

It's a fun and interactive way to play Rock-Paper-Scissors against the computer. Enjoy!
